linuxmuster-client-auth
-----------------------

This package enables an ubuntu client to auth against an ldap server
on the linuxmuster Server

* The ldap users "pgmadmin" and "administrator" have
  administrative rights via sudo
* Homedirs of ldap users ar created on the fly via pam_mkuserdir.so
  from /etc/skel
* This package has no profile managing capabilities

Tested on

* Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus Alpha2 
 
Attention:

* requires systemd so it is incompatible with Ubuntu < 15.04 
* only compatible with lightdm/mdm displaymanager

Remarks:

* should now also work stable in an subnetting environment
